Typical examples of distribution channels are wholesale, retail, or direct sales.  \nYou can maintain information about customers and materials by sales organization and distribution channel. Within a sales organization you can deliver goods to a given customer through more than one distribution channel.You can assign a distribution channel to one or more sales organizations. If, for example, you have numerous sales organizations, each sales organization may use the \"Wholesale\" distribution channel.For each combination of sales organization and distribution channel, you can further assign one or more of the divisions that are defined for the sales organization. You can, for example, assign \"Food\" and \"Non-food\" divisions to the \"Wholesale\" distribution channel. A particular combination of sales organization, distribution channel, and division is known as a sales area."

Example: 110100  --> 11.01.2000NoteIf you valuate validity parameters, you cannot specify intervals. You can only specify individual values.The following description does not apply to the valuation of validity parameters:If the characteristic format is numeric (NUM), time (TIME), or date (DATE), you can enter a number or (if allowed) an interval.Intervals are written in the following format:Value1 - Value2 (from Value1 to Value2)>Value1 (greater than Value1)>=Value1 (greater than or equal to Value1)<Value2 (less than Value2)<=Value2 (less than or equal to Value2)>Value1 - <Value2 (greater than Value1 and less than Value2)Value1 - <Value2 (greater than or equal to Value1 and less thanValue2)>Value1 - Value2 (greater than Value1 and less than or equal toValue2)If the characteristic has more than one value, you can enter multiple values separated by semicolons.If you have maintained a unit of measure for numeric values in the formatting data of the characteristic, the unit is displayed automatically when you confirm.NoteIf you want to define intervals as allowed values of a characteristic, you must define the characteristic as \"multiple-value\" when you maintain the characteristic in the Classification System. This also allows you to enter more than one interval.However, if you assign more than one interval to a characteristic of a class during configuration (for example, 1-2 and 5-6 for characteristic LENGTH), the system only reads one of the intervals when generating an inspection lot in QM. To avoid this problem, do NOT assign more than one interval to a characteristic."
